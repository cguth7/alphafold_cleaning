Phase 2A Extended: Author Novelty Analysis Processing Statistics
======================================================================

Input files:
  - processed/gene_disease_temporal_extended.parquet (2015-2023 data)
  - intermediate_data/pmids_authors_openalex_deduped.dta

Output file: author_novelty_extended.parquet

STEP 1: Author Data Merging
---------------------------
Initial extended temporal records: 22,195,971
Records with author data: 15,595,323
Merge success rate: 70.26%
PMID coverage rate: 65.02%
Unique authors identified: 659,374

STEP 2: Author Novelty Analysis (2015+ Baseline)
----------------------------------------------
Total author-gene pairs: 12,942,962
Newcomer author records: 12,942,962
Veteran author records: 2,652,361
Newcomer rate: 82.99%

STEP 3: AlphaFold Era Filtering
------------------------------
Extended baseline records: 15,595,323
AlphaFold era records: 13,673,571
Retention rate: 87.68%
AlphaFold newcomer rate: 81.34%

Final Output Summary
--------------------
Total records: 13,673,571
Unique PMIDs: 1,444,655
Unique genes: 19,690
Unique authors: 607,477
Time span: 2020-2023
Output file size: 141.1 MB

Key Improvement:
  - Uses proper 2015+ baseline for author novelty classification
  - More accurate newcomer/veteran distinctions in AlphaFold era
  - Addresses the original issue in 02A analysis

Novelty Flags Created:
  - newcomer_author: 1 for first publication by author on gene since 2015, 0 otherwise
  - not_newcomer_author: 1 for repeat publication by author on gene, 0 otherwise

Next Steps:
  - Aggregate to gene-month level for panel analysis
  - Merge aggregated author metrics into final panel
